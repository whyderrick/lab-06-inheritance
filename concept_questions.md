# Concept Questions:
(These are more open-ended than usual, because they’re big concepts. Don’t write more than 4 sentences. It’s ok to use Google Translate for this if you need to, so long as the first version of your answer is your own thoughts)

- What does the super keyword do?

- What is the difference between overriding a method and overloading a method?

- What is an abstract class?  

- What class is a superclass for every other class? What methods does it give? Why do we need a shared superclass for every other class?

- Suppose you have a program with the classes Boat, House, HouseBoat, and BoatHouse for representing boats, houses, houseboats (floating houses), and boathouses (a building for storing boats). Should any of those classes be subclasses of others? Why or why not?

- What does the final keyword prevent? When is a good time to use it?

- Suppose you are writing a Java program that does a lot of mathematical calculations involving π. You only need two decimal places of accuracy. You could use 3.14 everywhere π is needed in your code (like the formula area = 3.14 * π * r), or you could declare a constant PI equal to 3.14  and use that constant everywhere you need π (the formula becomes area = PI * π * r).
  - Show what that constant declaration looks like in Java
  - Give two reasons why using the declared constant PI is better than using 3.14 in your code.
